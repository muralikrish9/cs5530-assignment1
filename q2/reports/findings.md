# Student Performance Analysis - Report

## V1 - Gender Boxplots (Math vs Reading)

Male students have a higher median math score (69.0) compared to female students (65.0). In contrast, female students score higher in reading with a median of 73.0 versus 66.0 for males. The spread of math scores is similar for both genders, with comparable IQR values. Reading scores show a wider gap, with females consistently outperforming males. Both distributions are roughly symmetric with few outliers. This suggests a gender-based difference in subject strengths, with males leaning toward math and females toward reading. However, the overlap between distributions is substantial, meaning gender alone is not a strong predictor.

## V2 - Test Prep Impact on Math

Students who completed the test preparation course have a higher mean math score (69.7) compared to those who did not (64.1). The violin plot shows the completed group has a denser concentration of scores in the upper range. The none group has a wider tail toward lower scores. The median for the completed group is also noticeably higher. This indicates that test preparation has a measurable positive effect on math performance. However, some students who did not prepare still scored very high, suggesting other factors like prior knowledge or aptitude also play a role. Overall, test prep appears to shift the distribution upward by roughly 5.6 points on average.

## V3 - Lunch Type and Average Performance

Students with standard lunch have a higher overall average score (70.8) compared to those with free/reduced lunch (62.2). This difference is consistent across all three subjects. Math shows the largest gap between the two groups. Reading and writing scores follow a similar pattern but with slightly smaller differences. Lunch type is often used as a proxy for socioeconomic status. These results suggest that socioeconomic background has a noticeable impact on academic performance. The gap of approximately 8.6 points is significant and consistent.

## V4 - Subject Correlations

Reading and writing scores have the highest correlation (0.955), indicating students who read well also tend to write well. Math and reading show a moderate-to-strong correlation (0.818). Math and writing also correlate well (0.803). All three subjects move together positively, meaning strong students tend to perform well across the board. The reading-writing pair being strongest makes intuitive sense as both are language-based skills. Math has a somewhat lower correlation with the other two, suggesting it tests a more distinct skill set. No negative correlations exist, confirming that scoring well in one subject does not come at the cost of another.

## V5 - Math vs Reading Scatter with Trend Lines

There is a clear positive association between math and reading scores for both groups. The completed group (n=358) has a best-fit slope of 0.840, while the none group (n=642) has a slope of 0.861. The completed group's trend line sits higher, reflecting their overall better performance. Both slopes are similar, suggesting the rate at which math improves with reading is roughly the same regardless of test prep. The main effect of test prep appears to be an upward shift (intercept) rather than a change in slope. Scatter shows considerable overlap between groups, meaning prep is not the sole factor. Some students in the none group still achieve top scores, indicating natural aptitude or other preparation methods. Overall, the plot confirms that math and reading are moderately correlated and test prep provides a consistent but not dramatic advantage.
