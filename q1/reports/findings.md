## Correlation Analysis

Pearson correlation between Grip Strength (kg) and Frailty (binary): **-0.4759**

The negative correlation indicates that lower grip strength is associated with higher likelihood of frailty, which aligns with clinical expectations. Participants classified as frail tend to have weaker grip strength.
